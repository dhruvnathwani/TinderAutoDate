# TinderAutoDate

Dating sucks... so why not automate it!

Jokes aside, this was my first implementation of building a convolutional neural network to swipe on tinder for me. Given the obvious ethical and moral dillemas surrounding this, I have never used it in practice, but the edcuational component was fascinating nonetheless.
